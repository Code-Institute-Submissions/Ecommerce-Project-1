# Your Project's Name

In this project I am focusing on creating a website aimed towards the POP collector community.

Users will also be able to register and login to purchase items.

This project will use a postgres database, and the application itself will be set up using the Django web framework.

The primary target audience is anyone that has an interest in POP figures, whether they are casual collects or just shopping for the perfect gift. I Have added many diffrent types of POP figures to increase my target audience, Such as Disney figures, Looney Tunes for the younger audience and real life famous people and gaming figures for the older audience. In my opinion there is something for everyone. 
 
## UX
 
The site itself will follow standard web design conventions and so the layout and initial use of the site should feel immediately recognisable to almost all users, with those lacking experience in web browsing finding the website to be self-explanatory and easy to use/navigate.

The Home page will immediately inform the user of the site’s purpose, promoting the products that sell best. 

## User Stories

- As a user I’d like to be able to buy specific branded merchandise from the website
- As a user, I’d like for the website to be user-friendly and easy to navigate
- As a user, I’d like to be able to search the website/database for the products in the store that match the search criteria
- As a user, I'd like to be able to access the data and experience all the site has to offer, regardless of device and browser type being used

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
